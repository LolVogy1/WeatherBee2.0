#WeatherBee 2.0
WeatherBee is an app designed to provide forecasts for a city from multiple sources. 

Weather forecasts tend to vary wildly depending on where you're looking, so WeatherBee provides a way to gather data from multiple places so you can make your own conclusions.

This is currently being upgraded to version 2, making use of Django to provide a web application and hopefully looking better.

Why is it called WeatherBee? I don't know either üëç
